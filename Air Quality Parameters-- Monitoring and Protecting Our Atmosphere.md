Air quality is a critical aspect of environmental and public health management. Monitoring key air quality parameters helps us understand the state of our atmosphere and develop effective strategies to reduce air pollution and its impacts on human health and the environment. In this article, we will explore some essential air quality parameters, discuss the World Health Organization (WHO) standards, and provide easy-to-understand examples that demonstrate the importance of monitoring these parameters.

## Particulate Matter (PM)

Particulate matter (PM) is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. PM is classified into two categories based on size: PM10 (particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less) and PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less). Smaller particles, particularly PM2.5, are more dangerous to human health, as they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream.

Example: During wildfire events, large amounts of PM2.5 are released into the atmosphere, leading to poor air quality and increased respiratory and cardiovascular health risks for exposed populations.

WHO Standards: The WHO guidelines for PM2.5 are an annual mean of 10 µg/m³ and a 24-hour mean of 25 µg/m³. For PM10, the guidelines are an annual mean of 20 µg/m³ and a 24-hour mean of 50 µg/m³.

## Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)

Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a gaseous air pollutant primarily emitted from fuel combustion in vehicles, power plants, and industrial processes. NO₂ contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter and can cause respiratory problems, particularly in children and individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions.

Example: In heavily congested urban areas with high traffic volumes, NO₂ levels can be significantly elevated, leading to increased respiratory health risks for local residents and commuters.

WHO Standards: The WHO guidelines for NO₂ are an annual mean of 40 µg/m³ and a 1-hour mean of 200 µg/m³.

## Ozone (O₃)

Ozone (O₃) is a gas that occurs both in the Earth's upper atmosphere (stratospheric ozone) and at ground level (tropospheric ozone). Ground-level ozone is a secondary air pollutant formed by chemical reactions between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight. High concentrations of ground-level ozone can cause respiratory problems, exacerbate pre-existing respiratory conditions, and harm sensitive vegetation.

Example: On hot, sunny days with stagnant air conditions, ground-level ozone concentrations can reach harmful levels, particularly in urban areas with high VOC and NOx emissions.

WHO Standards: The WHO guidelines for O₃ are a maximum 8-hour mean of 100 µg/m³.

## Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)

Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) is a gaseous air pollutant primarily emitted from fossil fuel combustion in power plants and industrial processes. SO₂ can react with other substances in the atmosphere to form fine particulate matter and contribute to the formation of acid rain. Short-term exposure to SO₂ can cause respiratory problems, particularly for individuals with asthma.

Example: In areas with a high concentration of coal-fired power plants, SO₂ emissions can lead to elevated air pollution levels and contribute to respiratory health problems and environmental degradation from acid rain.

WHO Standards: The WHO guidelines for SO₂ are a 10-minute mean of 500 µg/m³ and a 24-hour mean of 20 µg/m³.
