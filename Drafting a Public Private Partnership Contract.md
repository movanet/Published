## What is a PPP?

This is a long discussion from both a theoretical and practical standpoints. The easiest way to understand a PPP is by looking at at the PPP Book which is published annually by the National Planning Agency. 

See for example, [this 2022 PPP Book](https://perpustakaan.bappenas.go.id/e-library/file_upload/koleksi/migrasi-data-publikasi/file/Policy_Paper/PPP%20Book%202022.pdf). You can see list of various project including those who are in the stage of planning. The World Bank PPLRC also have good resources for understanding PPP. This is an example of a [toll road PPP Documents](https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/library/road-concession-toll-road-agreement-example-1). This, is an example of a [concession PPP contract.](https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sites/ppp.worldbank.org/files/ppp_testdumb/documents/road%20concession%2010.pdf)

What is a Concession? A concession (see [wiki page here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concession_(contract))) is a spectrum of a private sector participation. Why a spectrum?
